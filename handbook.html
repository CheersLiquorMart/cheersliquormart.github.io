                <section id="general-policies" class="policy-subsection">
                    <h3>A. General Policies <a href="#" class="back-to-top">[Back to Top]</a></h3>
                    <p>First and foremost, we expect that all employees will treat every customer in a friendly, helpful, and courteous manner at all times. If you are on the sales floor, always greet customers and offer to help them locate products or answer questions they may have. If you are at the register, always ask customers if they found everything they were looking for and assist them if they did not and offer them carry-out assistance if it seems like they could use it. Always be mindful of the image you are presenting to customers; we expect you to conduct yourself in a professional manner and protect the reputation of the business.</p>
                    <p>We also expect all employees to treat each other in a courteous, professional manner every day. Being disrespectful, uncooperative, or disruptive will not be tolerated, nor will any other conduct that distracts from the level of service that the store promotes. We also expect that you will act with integrity and honesty every day.</p>
                    <p>The safety of our employees and customers is of utmost importance to us. Please immediately report any unsafe conditions to the General Manager or manager on duty. Keep aisles free of boxes or other debris, immediately clean spills, and mark wet floors with safety signage. Always use proper lifting techniques, ask for assistance with heavy items, and exercise caution when using ladders, cutting instruments, etc. Stay aware of your surroundings and use common sense to keep everyone safe.</p>

                    <h3>B. Hiring Policies <a href="#" class="back-to-top">[Back to Top]</a></h3>
                    <p>It is the policy of Cheers Liquor Mart not to discriminate against any applicant for employment or any employee because of color, race, religion, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, or any other protected characteristics. Applicants and employees are subject to background check, including motor vehicle driving records. Written consent must be obtained from applicant/employee before Company may access background checks. Because the nature of business is selling alcohol and other legally age-restricted products, Cheers must restrict employment to those 21 (twenty-one) years of age or older to maintain compliance with Federal, State, and local laws.</p>

                <section id="sexual-harassment" class="policy-subsection">
                    <h3>C. Sexual Harassment Policy <a href="#" class="back-to-top">[Back to Top]</a></h3>
                    <p>Sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Any employee who engages in sexual harassment will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. This policy covers employee conduct toward other employees, any vendors/distributors and their representatives, as well as any employee conduct toward customers. Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination and is illegal. Sexual harassment includes harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, self-identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity, and the status of being transgender. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct, which is either of a sexual nature, or is directed at an individual because of that individual's sex when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, even if the reporting individual is not the intended target of the sexual harassment.</li>
                        <li>Such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment.</li>
                        <li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for decisions affecting an individual's employment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, words, signs, jokes, pranks, intimidation or physical violence which are of a sexual nature, unwanted verbal or physical advances, or sexually explicit statements or remarks. Sexual harassment also occurs when a person in authority tries to trade job benefits for sexual favors, also known as quid pro quo harassment. This can include hiring, promotion, continued employment or any other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Examples of acts that may constitute sexual harassment and are expressly prohibited are, but not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Touching, pinching, grabbing, patting, kissing, hugging, brushing against or poking another employee's body.</li>
                        <li>Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, making explicit or implied threats or promises in return for submission to sexual favors, subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities.</li>
                        <li>Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes, or comments, including comments about appearance or physical features.</li>
                        <li>Displaying pictures, calendars, objects, or any other materials that are sexually demeaning or pornographic. This includes displays on computers or mobile devices and sharing such displays in the workplace.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any employee who witnesses or experiences sexual harassment is encouraged to report such behavior to the General Manager or the Office Manager. Retaliation against an individual for reporting sexual harassment is against the law and will not be tolerated. Disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment will be enforced, even if retaliation occurs outside of working hours.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Schedules for the following week are posted on the break room bulletin board on Fridays. Employees are responsible for checking and confirming their own schedules for the following week.</li>
                        <li>Any employee who fails to show up for a scheduled shift without notifying their supervisor will receive a written warning. A second occurrence will result in disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment. If an employee is absent without approved leave and/or advance notice for 3 (three) consecutive scheduled shifts the absence will be considered job abandonment and therefore an automatic resignation. In the case of a documented medical emergency employees may seek leave retroactively if the medical emergency was of such a nature that it prevented the employee from providing advance notice.</li>
                        <li>Employees are expected to arrive on time and be ready to start their shift at the scheduled time. Clocking in 5 (five) or more minutes later than scheduled shift start time is considered tardiness and consistent tardiness will result in disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment. If an employee anticipates that they will be late for their shift they are expected to call to notify their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled start time, or as soon as possible.</li>
                        <li>Employees are required to enter and exit the building through the front doors only. The receiving doors are for freight only and are to be only opened by a manager. The receiving doors shall NEVER be opened before 7:30 am or after 6:00 pm.</li>

                        <li>All hourly employees are required to document hours worked on their timecards. It is the employee's responsibility to maintain the accuracy of their timecard. In the event a correction is needed the employee may have their supervisor sign the timecard with the approved correction.</li>
                        <li>Timecard hours will be rounded to the nearest quarter of an hour.</li>
                        <li>Employees are not permitted to punch in or out for another employee. Any employee in violation of this policy will be immediately terminated from employment.</li>
                        <li>In the event an employee resigns their employment, any wages or compensation due will be paid on the next regular pay day.</li>
                        <li>In the event employment is terminated by the employer, any wages or compensation due will be paid at the time of discharge. If the employer's payroll department is not scheduled to be operational at that time, wages will be made available within 6 (six) hours after the start of the department's next regular workday.</li>
                        <li>If an employee feels that an error has been made in the calculation of their paycheck, they have 7 (seven) days from the date of the paycheck to address the issue with the Office Manager. Any resulting corrections will be included on the following regular paycheck.</li>
                        <li>Pay advances will not be made without the written approval of the Owner. Any advanced amount will only be for half of the hours that an employee has already clocked, no draws against future scheduled hours will be made.</li>

We understand that there may be times when you need to make/take personal calls or messages, however, watching videos, scrolling social media, playing games, etc. is absolutely not allowed while you are on the clock. This behavior has become rampant among employees, and if management, in its sole discretion, determines that employees are abusing the trust they are given to willingly comply with this policy, a workplace-wide ban of all cell phones/mobile devices will be implemented.

                        <li>There may be occasions when employees need to use their personal phone/device to conduct company business.

                        <li>Anyone caught using a device to record or share confidential company information will be subject to immediate termination of employment.</li>

                    <p>If you see anyone shoplifting, or attempting to shoplift, notify the manager on duty immediately and follow their instructions. Do not place yourself or anyone around you in danger to confront a shoplifter, no merchandise is worth the risk of injury to you or any other person.

                    <p>In the event someone approaches you with the intent to commit robbery, stay calm. Encourage others to remain calm and avoid any actions that may escalate the situation. Do not make any sudden moves, keep your hands visible, and do not talk or volunteer any more information than the robber may ask for. Cooperate with the robber and avoid confrontation. Your safety, and that of anyone else around you, are the highest priorities. Do not stare at the robber but do your best to make mental notes about the robber to assist with prosecution. Do not attempt to follow or chase the robber when they leave the store. As soon as it is safe to do so, lock the doors and call 911. Stay in control of your emotions and the surroundings as you wait for the police to arrive, do not conduct any business or touch anything that the robber may have touched. Ask any witnesses to stay until police arrive. If they must leave, obtain their name, address, and phone number. Do not give out any information regarding the robbery except to the police/law enforcement or store management.</p>
