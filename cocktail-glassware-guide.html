                <h2>Best Practices and Selling Points</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Chilled Advantage:</strong> Encourage customers to pre-chill their stemware (martini, Nick & Nora, or coupe) to preserve the integrity of up cocktails. A quick tip on proper serving can boost their confidence in using the glassware correctly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Versatility and Durability:</strong> Stress that investing in classic, versatile pieces like rocks and highball glasses not only enhances the drink's flavor and aroma but also adds to the overall aesthetic of a home bar. Quality glassware lasts for years, making it a smart long-term investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhancing the Drinking Experience:</strong> Explain how specialty glasses like the Glencairn focus and amplify the aromas of high-end spirits, appealing to customers who are serious about tasting their whiskey as intended.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Matters:</strong> With visually appealing options like margarita glasses, copper mugs, and tiki mugs, customers can elevate their cocktail presentation—transforming a simple drink into an experience that impresses guests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Selling Opportunities:</strong> Pair glassware with related retail items such as cocktail shakers, jiggers, and premium bitters or mixers. For example, when selling a set of Glencairn glasses, recommend a curated selection of fine whiskies available in-store to create a complete tasting package.</li>
