            <h2>Why Stories Really Matter</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stories hook customers and make them curious</li>
                <li>Products with stories seem more valuable and special</li>
                <li>Customers will pay more for drinks with interesting backgrounds</li>
                <li>Stories turn regular shopping into an experience</li>
                <li>Customers who hear stories remember your store and come back</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Ready-to-Use Product Stories</h2>

            <h3>BOURBON: Jefferson's Ocean</h3>
            <p><strong>The Simple Story:</strong> This bourbon travels on ships across the ocean. The waves, changing temperatures, and salty air give it unique flavors.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Say:</strong> "This bourbon actually ages while sailing at sea! The rocking of the ship and ocean air make it taste different from regular bourbon. People love how each batch is a little different depending on the voyage. It costs more because of this special aging process - but customers say it's worth every penny."</p>

            <h3>BOURBON: E.H. Taylor Tornado</h3>
            <p><strong>The Simple Story:</strong> A tornado hit the storage building where this bourbon was aging. Instead of ruining it, the exposure to the weather made it taste amazing.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Say:</strong> "See this bourbon? It survived a real tornado! The barrels were exposed to the elements, and it created a one-of-a-kind flavor. It's rare because it can't be made again - nature created something special by accident. That's why collectors get excited about it."</p>

            <h3>WINE: The Prisoner</h3>
            <p><strong>The Simple Story:</strong> This wine breaks all the rules. It's bold and different, just like its name and the artwork on the bottle.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Say:</strong> "Looking for something different? This wine is called The Prisoner because it doesn't follow the usual wine rules. The winemaker blends different grapes that aren't usually mixed together. Even wine experts were surprised by how good it tastes! The cool label is based on a famous painting, which makes it stand out on any dinner table."</p>

            <h3>TEQUILA: Código 1530</h3>
            <p><strong>The Simple Story:</strong> This tequila is made the old-fashioned way in Mexico, using clay ovens and wooden tanks like they did hundreds of years ago.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Say:</strong> "This tequila is made just like they did it in old Mexico. For years, it was a secret tequila only shared among Mexican families and not sold in stores. They still cook it slowly in clay ovens. That's why it tastes smoother than ordinary tequila - it's made with extra care and time."</p>

            <h3>VODKA: Crystal Head</h3>
            <p><strong>The Simple Story:</strong> This vodka comes in a cool skull bottle designed by a famous actor. It's filtered through real crystals to make it extra smooth.</p>
            <p><strong>What to Say:</strong> "Check out this skull bottle! It was created by actor Dan Aykroyd who wanted to make the purest vodka possible. The vodka inside is filtered through actual crystals, making it super clean-tasting. People often keep the empty bottle as decoration afterward - it's like getting two products in one!"</p>
