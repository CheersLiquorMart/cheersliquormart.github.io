            <div class="policy-section" id="purpose">
                <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
                <p>The safety of our employees and customers is our top priority. In the event of a robbery, this policy provides a safe and standardized response to minimize risk of harm and assist law enforcement with their investigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section" id="response-protocol">
                <h2>2. Response Protocol</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comply with the robber's demands:</strong> Do not resist, argue, or attempt to confront the robber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Avoid any sudden movements that could escalate the situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Put safety first:</strong> Prioritize personal and customer safety over store assets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be observant:</strong> Try to note details about the suspect (appearance, clothing, voice, weapons, etc.) without being obvious.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section" id="emergency-contact">
                <h2>3. Emergency Contact Procedures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Call 911 immediately</strong> once it is safe to do so and provide as many details about the incident and suspect as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notify management</strong> using the provided contact list in the order of escalation:
                        <ol>

            <div class="policy-section" id="surveillance">
                <h2>4. Surveillance and Security Measures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security cameras:</strong> The store is equipped with security cameras that record all activity. Ensure they remain unobstructed and functional.</li>
                    <li><strong>Know the equipment:</strong> Employees should familiarize themselves with the locations of all security cameras and panic buttons if applicable.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="policy-section" id="post-robbery">
                <h2>5. Post-Robbery Actions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secure the premises:</strong> Once the robber has left and it's safe, lock the doors to protect the scene and prevent re-entry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserve evidence:</strong> Do not touch or move anything at the crime scene. This helps law enforcement gather evidence (like fingerprints or dropped items).</li>
                    <li><strong>Assist police:</strong> When officers arrive, provide them with all observed details, security footage, and any other information they request. If there were witnesses, point them out or provide their contact information if available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document the incident:</strong> As soon as possible, write down all details of the incident while memories are fresh. Include descriptions of the suspect, what was said, the sequence of events, etc.</li>
                </ul>
