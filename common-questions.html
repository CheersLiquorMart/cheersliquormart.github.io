        <h1>Answering Common Questions</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Practice responses to the questions customers ask most frequently</p>

        <div class="training-content">
            <img src="public/images/customer-service.jpg" alt="A well-organized liquor store display with various wines and spirits, similar to the aisles at Cheers Liquor Mart." class="training-image">

            <p>Customers at Cheers Liquor Mart often have many questions about products, prices, and recommendations. It's important to answer clearly and cheerfully. This guide covers some frequently asked questions and sample answers you can use in your daily interactions.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Remember:</h4>
                <p>Answering questions well makes customers feel confident in their purchase and in you as a helpful employee. Even if you don't know everything, being friendly and willing to help goes a long way!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Product Recommendation Questions</h2>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"What's a good (wine/beer/liquor) for beginners/tonight's party?"</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>If it's wine:</strong> "For someone new to wine, a Moscato or Riesling is great because it's sweet and easy to drink. If you prefer less sweet, a Merlot is smooth and not too heavy."</p>

                    <p><strong>If it's beer:</strong> "You might try a light lager or a golden ale – they're not too bitter. Something like Coors Light is very mild, or a blonde ale from a local brewery could be a hit."</p>

                    <p><strong>If it's liquor:</strong> "For a beginner, spiced rum with a mixer (like cola) can be nice and smooth. Or a flavored vodka with juice – easy to drink and not harsh."</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"What's the difference between these two wines/beers?"</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Keep comparisons simple. For example: "The Cabernet Sauvignon is fuller-bodied and dry, while the Pinot Noir is lighter and a bit more fruity. It depends if they prefer a strong wine or a lighter one."</p>

                    <p>Another example: "This IPA beer is more hoppy and bitter, and that amber ale is smoother and maltier (a bit sweeter)."</p>

                    <p>If comparing whiskeys: "Bourbon is actually a type of whiskey made mainly from corn in the U.S., so it's a little sweeter. Scotch is a whiskey from Scotland, often with a smoky flavor. So they're both whiskeys, but the taste and where they're made differ." Keep it basic – one or two key differences the customer will understand.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Store Navigation Questions</h2>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"Where can I find [specific product or section]?"</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Answer with a smile and clear directions. "Sure! The craft beer section is in aisle 3, on the left side." If it's a specific product and you know exactly, you can even offer, "Let me show you," and walk them to it.</p>

                    <p>Knowing the store layout is key, so memorize where the major categories are (beer cooler, wine aisles by country, vodka and whiskey shelves, etc.).</p>

                    <p>If you're not sure, never guess – politely say, "Let me check that for you," and find out.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Price-Related Questions</h2>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"Why is this (brand) more expensive than that one?" (Price Objection)</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>This is common if a customer sees a big price gap. Explain value factors in simple terms: "Often the price is higher because of how it's made or how long it's aged. For example, this whiskey is aged 12 years which makes it smoother, so it costs more. The cheaper one is good but not aged as long."</p>

                    <p>You can also mention quality or origin: "This wine is from a famous region in France and won awards, so it's pricier. The other is a table wine meant for everyday drinking."</p>

                    <p>Offer an alternative: If the customer seems hesitant about the price, suggest: "We have a similar style at a lower price, if you'd like. For instance, [Other Brand] is a bit cheaper but also a dry red wine that's well liked." This shows you care about their budget.</p>

                    <p>Always stay understanding. Never say "because it's better," which might insult their budget choice. Instead, focus on facts (aging, ingredients, brand reputation) and then help them find something that fits their wallet.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"Do you have any deals or cheaper options?"</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Many customers hunt for bargains. Be ready to point out sales or promotions: "Yes! This week we have 10% off all local Colorado wines," or "Our bargain bin by the register has some good wines under $10."</p>

                    <p>If they specifically say a product is too expensive, suggest a value alternative: "If that craft beer 6-pack is a bit high, we have a similar style beer from another brewery that's a few dollars less. It's right over here."</p>

                    <p>Also mention any loyalty programs or discounts if your store has them, like "If you buy a case (12 bottles of wine), you get a discount," or "We have a loyalty card that gives you $5 off after 10 purchases." This addresses price concerns with solutions.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Product Information Questions</h2>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"How much alcohol is in this?" (Alcohol Content)</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Customers might ask which drink is stronger or about %ABV (alcohol by volume). You should know the basics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regular beers are around 5% ABV</li>
                        <li>Wines are about 12% ABV on average</li>
                        <li>Standard spirits (vodka, rum, whiskey) are about 40% ABV (which is 80 proof)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>So you can answer: "A typical beer has roughly 5% alcohol. Most wines are in the 12-14% range. Hard liquors like vodka or whiskey are much stronger – about 40% alcohol. This means one small shot of whiskey equals a whole glass of wine in terms of alcohol."</p>

                    <p>If they ask about a specific beer or wine, you can check the label with them (the ABV is usually printed there). It's okay to say, "Let's see, this one is 8% – a bit stronger than a typical beer." Helping them understand comparisons (like "8% is stronger, most light beers are 4-5%") makes you look knowledgeable and helpful.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>"What's a good mixer for this liquor?" (e.g. "What goes well with gin/rum?")</h4>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Keep a few popular mixers in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For gin, suggest tonic water or orange juice ("Gin and tonic is a classic, or gin with orange juice for something like an orange blossom cocktail.")</li>
                        <li>For rum, suggest cola or pineapple juice ("Rum and coke is very popular, or rum with pineapple juice for a tropical flavor.")</li>
                        <li>For whiskey, maybe ginger ale or cola</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If they ask for cocktail ideas, give one simple recipe: "With vodka, a simple mixer is cranberry juice for a vodka-cranberry." If your store sells mixers, you can literally point them out. If not, just give the advice. This kind of helpful tip not only answers the question but also builds trust that you know your stuff.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Final Tip:</h4>
                <p>You don't have to know everything. If you truly don't know an answer, it's fine to say, "That's a great question – let me ask my manager/check our guide real quick." It's better to double-check than guess. Over time, you'll learn the common answers.</p>
