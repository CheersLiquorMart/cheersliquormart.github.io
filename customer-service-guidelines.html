                <h3>Why Customer Service Matters</h3>
                <p>Customers are the reason our store exists—<strong>they are your paycheck</strong>. Without them, there is no store, and we don't have jobs. Every interaction matters. When we provide great service, customers return, buy more, and recommend us to others.</p>

                <h3>The Basics of Great Customer Service</h3>

                <h4>1. Acknowledge Every Customer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Make eye contact</strong> and greet customers as soon as they walk in.</li>
                    <li>A simple <strong>"Hey, how's it going?"</strong> or <strong>"Welcome in! Let me know if I can help."</strong> makes a difference.</li>
                    <li>If they seem like they need help, <strong>offer assistance</strong> before they have to ask.</li>
                    <li>Engaging with customers is also one of the best ways to prevent theft—when customers feel noticed and welcomed, they are far less likely to steal.</li>
                    <li>If you've made a connection and engaged with a customer, they are far less likely to steal.</li>
                    <li>Engaging with customers is one of the best ways to prevent theft.</li>
                    <li>Acknowledge everyone who enters the store—people are less likely to steal when they know they've been seen.</li>
                    <li>Offer assistance and stay visible to deter suspicious activity.</li>
                    <li>Strong customer service not only increases sales but also helps maintain a secure store environment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Connect with Customers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use their name</strong> if you know it. People appreciate being recognized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember what they drink.</strong> If they're a regular, mention their favorite bottle. Example:
                        <blockquote>"Hey Mike, your usual Buffalo Trace just came in!"</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Find common ground.</strong> Whether it's sports, weather, or a new product, small talk builds rapport.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Help Them Find What They Want</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a customer is looking for a specific product, walk them to it instead of pointing.</li>
                    <li>If we don't have what they want:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Suggest a similar item: "We don't have that right now, but this is a great alternative."</li>
                            <li>Offer to special order it: "We can order that for you if you'd like."</li>
                            <li>Give them a rain check for when it comes back in stock.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Upselling & Cross-Selling</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suggest something better: If they grab a bottle of wine, mention a slightly better option:
                        <blockquote>"That's a good choice, but this one is just a couple bucks more and really smooth."</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pair it with something else:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"That bourbon goes great with this old-fashioned mix."</li>
                            <li>"That vodka pairs well with this cranberry juice."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Let them know about deals: "If you buy two, you save a few bucks. Want to grab another?"</li>
                    <li>When a customer asks for a good red wine (or any recommendation), first ask what price range they're considering. Then, suggest options near the top of that range. This ensures we maximize the sale while staying within their budget. Offering something outside their budget—either too cheap or too expensive—risks losing the sale or leaving money on the table.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Keep the Store Running Smoothly</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock as you go. If you see empty shelves, fill them. A full store sells more.</li>
                    <li>Keep it clean. Wipe down counters, fix displays, and throw away trash.</li>
                    <li>Know what's in stock. Stay familiar with products so you can help customers quickly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. The Final Impression</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always thank the customer: "Appreciate you coming in!" or "Hope to see you again soon!"</li>
                    <li>Invite them back: If they ask about a product we don't have, let them know when it might arrive.</li>
                    <li>Make the checkout smooth: Be friendly, efficient, and make sure they leave happy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="policy-section">
                <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>Customers pay our bills. Every good interaction makes them more likely to return.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greet them.</li>
                    <li>Help them find what they need.</li>
                    <li>Offer alternatives or special orders.</li>
                    <li>Upsell and cross-sell when it makes sense.</li>
                    <li>Make a connection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Treat every customer like your best customer, and they'll keep coming back.</p>
